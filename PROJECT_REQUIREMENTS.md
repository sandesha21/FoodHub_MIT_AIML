# FoodHub Data Analysis Project Requirements

## Project Overview

### Context
The number of restaurants in New York is increasing day by day. Lots of students and busy professionals rely on those restaurants due to their hectic lifestyles. Online food delivery service is a great option for them. It provides them with good food from their favorite restaurants. 

A food aggregator company **FoodHub** offers access to multiple restaurants through a single smartphone app.

### Business Process
The app allows restaurants to receive a direct online order from a customer. The app assigns a delivery person from the company to pick up the order after it is confirmed by the restaurant. The delivery person then uses the map to reach the restaurant and waits for the food package. Once the food package is handed over to the delivery person, he/she confirms the pick-up in the app and travels to the customer's location to deliver the food. The delivery person confirms the drop-off in the app after delivering the food package to the customer. The customer can rate the order in the app. 

**Revenue Model**: The food aggregator earns money by collecting a fixed margin on the delivery order from the restaurants.

## Project Objective

The food aggregator company has stored the data of the different orders made by the registered customers in their online portal. They want to analyze the data to get a fair idea about the demand of different restaurants which will help them in enhancing their customer experience. 

**Your Role**: You are hired as a Data Scientist in this company and the Data Science team has shared some of the key questions that need to be answered. Perform the data analysis to find answers to these questions that will help the company improve its business.

## Data Description

The data contains different data related to a food order. The dataset includes information about orders, customers, restaurants, delivery times, and customer feedback.

### Data Dictionary

| Column Name | Data Type | Description |
|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| `order_id` | Integer | Unique ID of the order |
| `customer_id` | Integer | ID of the customer who ordered the food |
| `restaurant_name` | String | Name of the restaurant |
| `cuisine_type` | String | Cuisine ordered by the customer |
| `cost_of_the_order` | Float | Cost of the order (in USD) |
| `day_of_the_week` | String | Indicates whether the order is placed on a weekday or weekend<br>• Weekday: Monday to Friday<br>• Weekend: Saturday and Sunday |
| `rating` | String/Integer | Rating given by the customer out of 5<br>• Values: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, "Not given" |
| `food_preparation_time` | Integer | Time (in minutes) taken by the restaurant to prepare the food<br>• Calculated as: Restaurant order confirmation timestamp - Delivery person pick-up confirmation timestamp |
| `delivery_time` | Integer | Time (in minutes) taken by the delivery person to deliver the food package<br>• Calculated as: Delivery person pick-up confirmation timestamp - Drop-off timestamp |

## Key Business Questions to Answer

### 1. Data Exploration & Quality Assessment
- How many rows and columns are present in the data?
- What are the datatypes of the different columns?
- Are there any missing values? If yes, treat them appropriately.
- What is the statistical summary of the numerical data?

### 2. Customer Behavior Analysis
- How many orders are not rated?
- What is the distribution of ratings?
- What percentage of customers provide ratings?

### 3. Operational Performance Analysis
- What is the minimum, average, and maximum time for food preparation?
- What percentage of orders take more than 60 minutes to get delivered (preparation + delivery)?
- How does the mean delivery time vary during weekdays and weekends?

### 4. Restaurant & Cuisine Analysis
- Which are the top 5 restaurants in terms of number of orders?
- Which cuisine types are most popular?
- What is the distribution of orders across different restaurants?

### 5. Revenue Analysis
- Calculate net revenue generated by the company across all orders
- Commission structure:
  - Orders > $20: 25% commission
  - Orders $5-$20: 15% commission  
  - Orders ≤ $5: 0% commission
- Identify revenue optimization opportunities

### 6. Customer Satisfaction Analysis
- Which restaurants should be recommended for a promotional campaign?
- Criteria: Restaurants with more than 50 orders AND average rating > 4.0
- Analyze the relationship between cost, delivery time, and ratings
- Implement machine learning models to predict customer satisfaction
- Develop customer churn prediction models
