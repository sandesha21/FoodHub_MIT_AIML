# FoodHub Analysis

## Overview  
This project focuses on analyzing real-world online food delivery data from **FoodHub**, a food aggregator operating in New York. The goal is to uncover patterns in restaurant demand, order behavior, and delivery performance to help the company optimize its operations, improve customer satisfaction, and make data-driven strategic decisions.

## Objective  
The primary objective was to explore customer order data, identify key business insights, and provide actionable recommendations. By understanding order trends, popular restaurants, peak demand times, and delivery metrics, the analysis aims to support better decision-making for marketing, logistics, and partnership strategies.

## Dataset  
- **Source:** Provided as part of the project coursework  
- **Size:** 1,898 customer orders across 178 restaurants  
- **Customers:** 1,200 unique customers  
- **Cuisine Types:** 14 different cuisine categories  
- **Key Features:**  
  - Order ID and customer identification  
  - Restaurant names and cuisine types  
  - Order costs and day of week (weekday/weekend)  
  - Customer ratings (3-5 scale or not given)  
  - Food preparation time and delivery time (in minutes)  
- **Target:** Not applicable (exploratory analysis project)

## Workflow  
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** – Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and standardized categorical fields.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Conducted univariate and bivariate analysis to identify trends in order frequency, restaurant performance, and delivery times.  
3. **Visualization & Insights** – Built visual dashboards using Matplotlib and Seaborn to illustrate peak order times, best-performing restaurants, and delivery performance patterns.  
4. **Business Recommendations** – Translated analytical findings into actionable strategies for FoodHub’s marketing and operations teams.

## Key Findings  
- **Food Preparation Time:** Ranges from 20-35 minutes with an average of 27.37 minutes  
- **Customer Ratings:** 38.78% of orders are unrated, with ratings distributed as 5★ (31%), 4★ (20%), 3★ (10%)  
- **Order Distribution:** Analysis covers both weekday and weekend ordering patterns  
- **Restaurant Performance:** Identified top-performing restaurants by order volume and customer satisfaction
